# Scripts Folder

This folder contains Python scripts for project-related tasks.

## Scripts
- **clean_data.py**: Cleans raw datasets by removing rows with missing values and outputs the cleaned data.

## How to Use
1. Ensure your raw data file (`raw_data.csv`) is in the `/Data` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python clean_data.py

This approach is simpler and fulfills the requirement without the extra complexity of a notebook. Let me know if you need help setting up the script!
