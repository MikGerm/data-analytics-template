# Data Folder

This folder contains the datasets used in the project. Due to issues with web scraping, some files were manually downloaded to ensure progress.

- **Cleaned_Crime_Data.csv**: Cleaned crime statistics for major U.S. cities (2019-2023).
- **Cleaned_Educational_Data.csv**: Cleaned educational attainment data for major U.S. cities.
- **Merged_Educational_Crime_Data.csv**: Attempted merged dataset for educational attainment and crime data.

### Notes:
- Crime data was downloaded from open data portals and cleaned in Jupyter Notebooks.
- Educational data was manually downloaded from Census.gov after web scraping failed due to dynamic content and anti-scraping measures.
- Merging the datasets faced challenges, so separate visualizations were used for analysis.
